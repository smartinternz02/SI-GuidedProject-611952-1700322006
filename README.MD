Due to the size of the tensorflow module and keras module libraries we were unable to add the virtual enviroment set up folder. 
Please download and add the following the files to the respective folders.
From Dataset and Model folder, add the Final.h5 file to the main folder (in the same directory as the ipynb notebook) not model folder. The model folder exists to save the trained model by the ipynb notebook
Dataset has three folders called train, valid and test to be added to the main folder in the same directory as the ipynb notebook.
These are the following modules used, please install them using pip after setting up the virtual enviroment
